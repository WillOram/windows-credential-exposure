# Limiting the exposures of credentials when connecting to servers

Microsoft guidance from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access-reference-material). Explains the credential exposure associated with using different administrative tools for remote administration. 

## Administration methods

| Connection   method                              | Logon type            | Reusable credentials on   destination | Comments                                                                                                                                          |

| Remote Desktop (failure - logon type was denied) | RemoteInteractive     | -                                     | By   default, if RDP logon fails credentials are only stored very briefly. This   may not be the case if the computer is compromised.             |
